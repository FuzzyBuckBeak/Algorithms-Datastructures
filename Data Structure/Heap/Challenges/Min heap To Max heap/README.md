# Convert Min Heap to Max heap

>The problem might look complex at first look. But our final goal is to only build the max heap. The idea is very simple â€“ we simply build Max Heap without caring about the input. We start from bottom-most and rightmost internal mode of min Heap and heapify all internal modes in bottom up way to build the Max heap.
