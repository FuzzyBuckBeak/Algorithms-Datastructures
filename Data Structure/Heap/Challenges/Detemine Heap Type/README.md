# Determine the Heap Type

### To check if the given array is a binary heap and determine the type of the Heap.

Output: I
- f it is a Max heap return "Max heap Type"
- if It is a Min heap return "Min heap Type" 
- else return "Not a valid Heap Type"


You will need to go through all the parent nodes of the binary heap to check for the properties

### Properties of Heap:
1. In a max heap, parent nodes must always contain a value that is greater than or equal to the value in its children. The root node will always contain the highest value.
2. In a min heap, parent nodes must always contain a value that is less than or equal to the value in its children. The root node will always contain the lowest value.
